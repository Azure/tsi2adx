# TSI to RTI (Real-Time Intelligence)
Using Fabric Eventhouse or ADX

## Description
This repo contains collateral that can be leveraged to migrate from TSI to Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) or Azure Data Explorer (ADX). 

The Microsoft **Cloud Migration Factory** program accepts customer [nominations](https://aka.ms/cmf) to help our TSI customers migrate to Fabric RTI or ADX, by providing hands-on keyboard resource(s) at no-cost to the customer. Hands-On keyboard resource(s) are assigned for a period of 6-8 weeks with an agreed scope. The hands-on keybard resource and customer can leverage the tools & collateral shared in this repo to complete the migration. Customres can contact their account team Data & AI Specialist, Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM) or Cloud Solution Architect (CSA) to submit a nomination. 

## Readiness
A workshop can be proctored by a Microsoft representative or SME, as a 1/2-day remote-session, to explain & demonstrate how-to migrate end-to-end. Using a mix of presentations, demos and available tooling, the workshop upskill attendies why they should migrate & how. Azure Time Series Insights (TSI) service will no longer be supported [after March 2025](https://aka.ms/tsi2adx). Consider migrating existing TSI environments to alternative solutions as soon as possible. The workshop will share a look at the feature comparisons with ADX and help execute migration steps.
