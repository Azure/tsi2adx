[wip] - work in progress
- screenshots of lightingest from pptx
- link to download cli tool
- screenshots of ADF/Fabric Pipelines (no-code/low-code method)
- context when to do one vs other
- considerations for Update Policies, transformations, building out the ingestion, then proceeding with running the tool for rest of migration.
