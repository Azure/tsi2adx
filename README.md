### Workshop Introduction
TSI to ADX Migration workshop is a 1/2-day proctor-led that explains how to migrate through a series of presentations, demos and tooling. Azure Time Series Insights (TSI) service will no longer be supported [after March 2025](https://aka.ms/tsi2adx). Consider migrating existing TSI environments to alternative solutions as soon as possible. The workshop will share a look at the feature comparisons with ADX and help execute migration steps.
